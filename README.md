# Telescope Data Analysis Using PCA

## Overview
This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to telescope data to reduce dimensionality and reveal key patterns within the dataset. By reducing the complexity of high-dimensional data, the analysis helps in identifying important features while improving computational performance.

## Key Objectives
1. Reduce the dimensionality of telescope data using PCA.
2. Visualize and interpret the principal components.
3. Understand the variance explained by each component and its significance.
4. Identify patterns that can help in further scientific exploration.

## Key Features
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Applies PCA to reduce the number of features while retaining the most informative components.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Generates a correlation matrix and visualizes it using a heatmap.
- **Explained Variance:** Analyzes and visualizes the variance explained by each principal component.
- **Interpretation of Results:** Identifies key features and patterns based on the transformed data.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telescope-pca.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the notebook:
    Open and execute the `Telescope_Analysis_with_PCA.ipynb` file in a Jupyter environment to follow the analysis step by step.

## Results
- Dimensionality reduction with key components identified.
- Visualizations of the correlation matrix and principal components.
- Insights into the structure and significance of the data.
